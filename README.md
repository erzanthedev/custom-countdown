# ⏳ Custom Countdown Project ⏳

Welcome to my Custom Countdown project!
This project is an exciting journey into building a personalized countdown timer from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I started this project with a template that provided some basic CSS for the appearance.
From there, I expanded the project significantly by adding more HTML for structure, additional CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.

## ✨ Purpose

The main goal of this project was to learn and understand how to build a custom countdown timer using JavaScript.

This involved:

- Manipulating user interactions
- Implementing animations
- Understanding DOM manipulation

## 🔍 Features

- **Three Sections**:
  - **Form/Input Section**: Collects user input for the countdown.
  - **Countdown Section**: Displays the countdown after the user provides input.
  - **Complete Section**: Checks if the countdown is complete and shows animations.
- **Form Validation**: Added logic to validate user input to ensure proper functionality.
- **Event Listeners**: Each section has buttons with event listeners that trigger corresponding functions.
- **Local Storage**: Implements logic to save and remember user input for future sessions.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript, especially in handling events and local storage.
- **Event Handling**: Improved skills in setting up and managing event listeners.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Enhanced ability to manipulate the DOM to create responsive and interactive web applications.
- **Form Validation**: Implemented form validation to ensure data integrity and enhance user experience.
- **CSS Animations**: Applied CSS animations to improve the visual appeal and user experience of the countdown timer.
